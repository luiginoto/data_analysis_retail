# Data Analysis of US retail companies

This project consists of the analysis US retail companies data, by estimating and comparing panel data regression models to draw marketing insights and managerial implications and by estimating fixed-effect autoregressive models to detect the proportion of potentially myopic management behaviors in the sector. \
It was carried out in collaboration with other Bocconi University students (Roberto Minini, Bernardo Principi, Anna Russo, Martina Totaro). \
We used both Python and Stata in the same notebook through the Stata Python Magic [*IPyStata*](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/ipystata), thereby taking advantage of Python libraries to do the preprocessing and plot some graphs for the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and of Stata functions to easily estimate and compare the econometric models.
